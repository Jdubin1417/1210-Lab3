    <h1>Welcome to College!</h1>
    <p class='intro'>
        For some of you, this is your first semester in a university setting. Others have been here a while. Regardless, there are a lot of differences between college life and the schooling you've experienced thus far. Here are some bits of wisdom from various web sites:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Go to class</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This may seem like a 'no-brainer' piece of advice, but, Oh! it's so tempting to sleep in. After all, you're a college student! You can do what you want, right? Well, you sure can if you want to scramble to hold a GPA than to attempt to brint it up!
    </p>

    <ol start="2">
        <li>Know what you can handle course-wise</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        It is much better to finish a semester 'late' (who doesn't these days?) than to have a nervouse breakdown of over-scheduling yourself. In the bigger picture, a few months or even a year does not make that much of a difference, unless you want to brag about how you finished school on time.
    </p>

    <ol start="3">
        <li>Get involved</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
            You might be attending school in a different state, or even in your own state. Either way you can afford to expand your interests and meet new people. College is an easy way to make contacts and new friends!
    </p>
    
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Make friends in your program who are ahead of you</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
            This way you might be able to borrow their notes and/or lab reports. Often, they can offer guidance with your coursework (and you'll be doing them a favor, in a sense: the best way to learn something is to help someone else.)
    </p>

    <ol start="5">
        <li>Keep in touch with your family</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
            Yes, you should make contacts and friends at college. This does not mean you should ignore your family who likely supports you, or encouraged you to get where you are today. Give them a call, Skype them, send them a card, or do something during the semester to let them know you are thinking about them.
    </p>

    <ol start="6">
        <li>Stay in touch with old friends</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
            One of my biggest regrets in life was falling out of touch with high school friends. if you don't keep in touch, the day will come when you'll regret it.
    </p>

    <ol start="7">
        <li>Be silly</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
            You have a little bit of margin during this time to get away with crazy things and not look too foolish (hey, it's college!) Use this time to go on adventures and do silly things that likely will be looked down upon later in life. This is also a great way to bond with your new friends.
    </p>

    <ol start="8">
        <li>Don't be afraid of your teachers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
            Most, if not all, of us are here because we want to be; because we love teaching. If you're struggling with something, don't hesitate to reach out for help.
